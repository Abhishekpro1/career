                    <p style="text-align:justify">Courses after Graduation were not much sought after, few years back. Courses after Graduation in India eventually picked up with IT revolution and advancement in academic scenario, especially in the western world. After graduation courses, today have gained importance both on academic and employment level. There are various courses after graduation, which are increasing in number every year. There are diploma courses after graduation, one year courses after graduation, short term courses after graduation and so on. </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Graduation is a big turning point in life, at this stage one generally goes for a career rather than go for post graduate studies. While it is a good choice to go for a job as not everyone wants to spend a few more years studying. Cost of study is another deterrent factor and so is the urge to earn as quickly as possible. But, the cutthroat competition means that you need to be exceptional. That is one reason why courses after graduation in India have become popular and widely accepted as a necessity rather than just another accomplishment. </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify"> <br>So whether these are - courses after graduation in arts, courses after graduation in commerce, courses after graduation in science or courses after graduation in engineering, they have acquired a great importance in one’s resume and employability. Also, there are many integrated and interdisciplinary courses which not only save a year but also provide extra knowledge and degree as well. It is advisable to go for those courses which one can really complete and not leave it in the middle due to extra burden or sudden lack of interest. One does not need to go for a long post graduate degree course; there are many 1 year courses, few months’ diploma courses and few weeks or days certification courses. It is not necessary that one should go for after graduation courses, only of post graduate level; one can study </p>
