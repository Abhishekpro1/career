                            <p>In India, Bachelor of Technology degree is a professional engineering undergraduate degree awarded after completion of four years of academic study in engineering field. It is offered in many disciplines .In simple words, we can say that “B.Tech is that UG course after which you can become an engineer”.Bachelor of Technology is also known as Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) in many institutions. Study curriculum is same for both B.Tech and B.E. so don’t be confused in names.The term engineering comes from Latin word Ingenium means ‘Cleverness and Ingeniare means ‘to create’.There is a huge craze among the young students for engineering. Mostly science stream students want to become engineer and opt B.Tech after the completion of 12th.</p>
