                            <p style="text-align:justify ">In third and fourth year of engineering course, engineering students start getting worried about what to do after completing the course. There are many career opportunities waiting for you outside your college. All you need is to grab some knowledge regarding these jobs and spend some time in learning the skill required in these jobs. Having clear about what you want to do in your life can help you in landing successful career.<br>
                            Below we have given some options which you can consider after completing your BTech course.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">If you could not get good job after college, then you can always go for higher education and increase your chances of job. But it is generally seen that very few people are interested in higher education as investing in higher education yield long term benefits. Many universities conduct their own admission test but the most common exam for MTech admission is Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineering (GATE) examination.<br>
                    Many students go for a M.S. degree from a foreign university. To do M.S. you must clear TOEFL/IELTS (English proficiency tests) and GRE to get scholarships. Now a day most of the foreign universities are offering post graduate courses at affordable costs and also many banks provide loans for higher studies.</p>

                <h2 class="title-default-left title-bar-high" id="bsc"><b><a href="#">2. Doing MBA</a></b></h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Many students want to do an MBA after completion of their engineering course. An MBA degree after engineering is considered rewarding in terms of salary. Engineers with good technical skills get bored in a few years, doing the same stuff, and without a management exposure, they may be stuck in a groove. A degree in MBA gives you more exposure and helps you earning more in very less time. Also, it happens that most engineering students come from Tier 2 and Tier 3 colleges and an MBA degree from renowned institute in India/abroad can add much to their resume.<br>
                In India IIMs are considered as the most prestigious business schools. They take admission through Common Admission Test (CAT) which is conducted by IIMs.
                    The result of CAT 2016 shows that it is dominated by engineers. In CAT 2016 as many as 20 candidates have scored overall 100 percentile in the Common Admission Test (CAT) and all the 20 candidates were engineers. So doing an MBA from a prestigious engineering college is always good.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">Every Indian at a sooner or later stage in his life dreams to be an IAS officer because this is most prestigious job and carries with it a lot of responsibility. It is the backbone of India. Although corporate jobs may offer the best of salaries and perks, a majority of engineering aspirants still crave entry to the prestigious Indian Civil Services held by the UPSC.
                    According to the 65th Annual Report of the Union Public Service Commission, in Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) more than half of the candidate qualifying exam comprise of engineers.</p>

                    <p>This is the best option for you when you have unique business idea and you have also money to invest in your business. Entrepreneurship is the most new thing everyone is doing and you should also do it too. But do not get carried away by the idea of becoming popular and rich in very less time. It may happen but do consider this as learning opportunity.
                    Many who do not have wealthy family background should join some job so that they can earn money to invest and gather experience about how things work in corporate world. Do not start a start up just to impress someone or to be rich in very less time. Every action requires an appropriate time to give result. Give time to your action.</p>
