The course aims to investigate humankind and human society, from the physical evolution of the human body and brain, through to the political, cultural and linguistic practices of modern societies. Anthropology is the science of the origin of the mankind. It covers the history of the development of human beings and the social, cultural and physical growth and behavior of mankind. Although anthropology was a Natural Science originally, but over the years it has evolved into a much technical and complex field which not only studies the human society but how the human evolution came into being; and today it is treated as a great supporter of multiculturalism and pluralism.</p>
