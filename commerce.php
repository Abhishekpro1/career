                            <p>Digital marketing encompasses all marketing efforts that use an electronic device or the internet. Businesses leverage digital channels such as search engines, social media, email, and their websites to connect with current and prospective customers.With how accessible the internet is today, would you believe me if I told you the number of people who go online every day is still increasing?It is. In fact, "constant" internet usage among adults increased by 5% in just the last three years, according to Pew Research. And although we say it a lot, the way people shop and buy really has changed along with it -- meaning offline marketing isn't as effective as it used to be.</p>

                            <p>There are no absolute educational requirements to become a journalist. However, if you’re looking to work professionally in print, broadcast, or Internet journalism, it’s important to demonstrate to potential employers that you have the right knowledge base and the practical skills to get the job done. A two-year associate degree program is one way to begin this process. But, because journalism is such a broad field that encompasses political reporters, sports reporters, entertainment reporters, science and technology reporters, and health and fitness reports, as well as photographers, videographers, and a range of other specialists who may contribute various specialized skills to a media project, it’s more common for journalists to pursue a four-year bachelor’s degree.</p>
